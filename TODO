====
* TODO Add support for physical units (through ModelParameters)
* DONE Add support for LaTeX output
* DONE Add support for Matlab output
* DONE Move gosscode generator to goss
* TODO Add support for SBML input
* DONE Add support for a specific Markov model editor
  With this we can facilitate a more easy editing of Markov models:
  
  : mm = markov_model("Some ion channel", c0=0.1, c1=0.1, O=0.8, degenerate="c0")
  : parameters("Some ion channel", r0=0.5, r1=0.6, r2=0.5, r3=1.0)
  : mm.rates[c0, c1] = r0*V
  : mm.rates[c1, c0] = r1*Cai
  : mm.rates[c1, O] = r2
  : mm.rates[O, c1] = r3

  This would define the whole markov model. 

  If degenerate is included in the constructor we assume the sum of
  all states are 1, and behind the scene we set

  : c0=1-(c1+O)

  The above example would create a component, see below, with 2 states
  and 1 intermediate.

* TODO Modularize a gotran model
  By tagging each one of the four main parts of a gotran file:

    a) states

    b) parameters

    c) intermediates

    d) derivatives

  with a component name we could more easily export the model to 
  CellML. We need to figure out a good way to do this for derivatives
  and intermediates.

* TODO Import other gotran models
  With this feature we could allow stand alone gotran models to be
  imported into others. 

  : import_ode("Kv3")

  We need to be carefull about how this is implemented. Several
  potenetial problems might occur:

  a) A parameter in the imported model can be a state in the mother
     model

  b) A parameter in the imported model can be an intermediate in the
     mother model

  We therefor need some way to map these variables. If there is a 1-1
  correspondance between names, the mother model symbols should be
  used. We can also add syntax for mapping model symbols:

  : import_ode("Kv3", V=v, V_over_RT=VoverRT)

  But this should be avoided as far as possible. The modeler should
  strive to use unique names

  Modularization through components we could also allow imports of
  single components into a gotran file
