Gotran - General ODE TRAnslator
===============================

Gotran:

  - provides a Python interface to declare arbitrary ODEs.

  - provides and interface for generating code for typically a right
    hand side for C/C++/Python.

  - is intentionally lightweight, and could be interfaced by other
    Python libraries needing functionalities to abstract a general
    ODE.

  - depends on NumPy, and indirectly on SymPy through the package
    ModelParameters. See further instructions in INSTALL
